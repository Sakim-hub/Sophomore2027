    <h1>Computer Networks</h1>

      <p>Welcome to Computer Networks and over the past 2 months in rhis class room we learned how to take apart a computer and what the components of the computer does to let the computer run. this portfolio will go over some of the many topics that we went over this quarter.</p>
    <h3>Computer components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Case and form factors</h3></li>
      <p>"form factor" refers to the standardized size, shape, and physical specifications of hardware components like motherboards, cases, and power supplies, ensuring compatibility and interchangeability</p>
      <li><h3>Motherboard</h3></li>
      <p>a printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be slotted.</p>
      <li><h3>BOI/UEFI</h3></li>
      <p>a modern firmware interface that replaces the traditional BIOS, serving as a bridge between the operating system and hardware, facilitating the initialization process and providing a standardized way for the OS to interact with the system firmware. </p>
      <li><h3>Memory</h3></li>
      <p>the electronic components that store data and instructions for quick access by the processor, enabling the computer to function and perform tasks. </p>
      <li><h3>Processors</h3></li>
      <p>the primary component that executes instructions and performs calculations, acting as the "brain" of the computer. </p>
      <li><h3>Video and Expantion cards</h3></li>
      <p>an expansion card (also known as an expansion board or add-on card) is a printed circuit board that plugs into a computer's motherboard to enhance its functionality, while a video card (or graphics card) is a type of expansion card specifically designed to process and render graphics for display. </p>
      <li><h3>Cooling</h3></li>
      <p>required to remove the waste heat produced by computer components, to keep components within permissible operating temperature limits.</p>
      <li><h3>Power Suply</h3></li>
      <p>converts the alternating current (AC) from the wall outlet into the direct current (DC) needed by the computer's components to function. </p>
    </ul>
